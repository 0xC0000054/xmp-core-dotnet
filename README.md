This library is a port of Adobe's XMP SDK to .NET.

Initially ported by Yakov Danila and Nathanael Jones, the project is now maintained
by Drew Noakes and contributors on GitHub.

The API should be familiar to users of Adobe's XMPCore 5.1.2, though it has been modified
in places to better suit .NET development.

The [same BSD license](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp/sdk/eula.html) applies to this project
as to the Adobe's open source XMP SDK from which it is derived.
